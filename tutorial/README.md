Cocos2d-HTML5 wiki article lists:

The articles are organized by the following rules:

Each article are named en.md/zh.md/ja.md which means these articles are written in English/Chinese/Japanese.

Each article is under a folder which name is the article's title. The folder name will be added a prefix number to indicate the order of each article.

All image related to the article are laid down along with the en.md/zh.md/ja.md file in the same directory

This kind of organization rules have the following advantages:

When you open the directory, you can preview the document in github immediately.

We can easily separate articles and related images into a well organized location.

For example:

We have two articles named Setup Development Environment and Getting Started .

It will be organized like this:

---1.0-Setup-Development-Environment(Directory)

------en.md(article)
------zh.md(article)
------ko.md(article)
------ja.md(article)

--------xxx.png(image)

--------xxxpng(image)

---2.0-Getting Started(Directory)

------en.md(article)
------zh.md(article)
------ko.md(article)
------ja.md(article)
