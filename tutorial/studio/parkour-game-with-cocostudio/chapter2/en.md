## Download CocoStudio

The CocoStudio can be downloaded at our official website: http://download.cocos2d-x.org/

## Taking a Look at the Built-in Examples

### Taking a Look at the Tests

All tests of the CocoStudio’s API can be found in Cocos2d-html5. For example, to know how to make a frame event with armature, you run the Cocos2d-html5 and you can see it under CocoStudio test called “Test Frame Event”, and the code of these tests is in the project 
“Cocos2d-html5/samples/CocoStudioTest/ArmatureTest/ArmatureTest.js”.
