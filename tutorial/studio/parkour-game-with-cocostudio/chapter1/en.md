# What is CocoStudio

CocoStudio is a professional game development  tool based on Cocos2d-x. It promises to be free of charge in an infinite duration. With CocoStudio, developers can create game resources quickly and simplify most of the tedious development work with the four editors provided. They are UI Editor, Animation Editor, Scene Editor and Data Editor. These four editors cover the core process of game development by dealing with animation resources, UI interface, gaming scene and gaming data. Also, each of them has been specifically designed for the best of the corresponding role in the development team and therefore allows everyone to perform his/her duties with least misuse and most efficiency. In brief, CocoStudio will help you achieve high productivity and quality with low risk and cost.

The birth of CocoStudio was no accident. We have met so many problems when we get started with the FishJoy2 in 2012. As the Cocos2d-x didn't have any visualization tools when it came to UI appearence or animations of roles, it used to take a great deal of time for programers to modify their programs to fit the requirements from game deisigners. At that time, we were considering about developing a visual toolkit to help to solve these problems. Then we developed a toolkit called SP-II to support FishJoy2 at first. Half a year later, we processed this SP-II and released the first official version of this toolkit on April 2013, and that was CocoStudio.

## UI Editor

UI Editor is an editor that edits all the Graph Interfaces, used mostly by art designers. They import ready interface images into the editor and place, design, edit, joint and modify them in the light of the design scheme. Then, with edited UI resource exported, they can be used directly into the game codes. The UI Editor embraces all plug-ins of Cocos2d-x and it has extended some of them, satisfying various demands of UI plug-ins during the developing process. It is also supportive of individual image exporting, whole image exporting, UI template, UI animation and other practical uses.

## Animation Editor

Animation Editor is an editor that edits dynamic game resources such as character animation, special-effect animation and scene animation. Art designers would be using it more often than other people. After importing ready image resources into the editor, they are able to put on various animation effects according to the design scheme and preview them in the editor. The editor supports key frame animation, sequence frame animation, bone animation, etc. Also, it allows for a wide range of resource optimization methods like exporting individual images or the whole image, as well as parse of Flash, PSD and Plist resources.

## Scene Editor

An editor for designing scene elements and game levels. With the editor, planners are able to integrate a mix of diverse game resources, including animation resources, UI resources, map resources, particle resources, image resources, audio, etc. Meanwhile, it can also be used to edit logical resources such as collisions, triggers, and controllers. Furthermore, the editor supports simulation operation, meaning that one can run the current scene in the simulator or his/her phone via wireless connection.

## Data Editor

The data designers import tables of values into this editor, break down the complicated ones, and then export them as common data files such as table of attribute or data. A wide range of different data arrangements can be choosed from data manager while exporting as the editor supports index.anima
