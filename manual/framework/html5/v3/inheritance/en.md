#Object construction and class inheritance in Cocos2d-JS v3.0#

Object creation in Cocos2d-JS have always been the same way as in Cocos2d-x, that is using `create` functions of each class. In Cocos2d-JS v3.0 we'd like to introduce you the classic way to create an object: `new` operator. Moreover, in v3.0 alpha1, if you use JSB you will not be able to inherite many engine classes because we haven't found a perfect solution. But this have been solved in v3.0 alpha2. Thanks to the `new` operator support, the inheritance code is much more easier too.

In this document, we will introduce not only how to use them, but also some implementation explanation in brief.

##1. Deprecated create functions##

As we supported an easier way to create objects, all `create` and `createWithXXX` functions have been deprecated. `new` construction supports all parameter combinations for old `create` functions.

##2. Constructor##

In Cocos2d-JS 3.0, we can use the `new` operator to call classes' constructor now. For example, developers should create a Sprite object with the `new` operator, it's supported both in html5 and jsb, but the implementations of them are quiet different.

	var sprite = new cc.Sprite(filename, rect);
	var sprite = new cc.Sprite(texture, rect);
	var sprite = new cc.Sprite(spriteFrameName);

In html5 engine, we have refactored all in engine classes' `ctor` functions to support the same parameters as create functions.

In JSB, we actually call js\_cocos2dx\_Sprite\_constructor in C++ level by using `new` operator of cc.Sprite. In this C++ function we allocate memory for this sprite and add it to autorelease pool, and then execute `_ctor` function in js level for initialization using initWithXXX functions, they are also supported in js bindings:

| Javascript | JSB | Cocos2d-x |
| ---------- |-----|-----------|              
| cc.Sprite.initWithSpriteFrameName | js_cocos2dx_Sprite_initWithSpriteFrameName | cocos2d::Sprite::initWithSpriteFrameName |
| cc.Sprite.initWithSpriteFrame | js_cocos2dx_Sprite_initWithSpriteFrame | cocos2d::Sprite::initWithSpriteFrame |
| cc.Sprite.initWithFile | js_cocos2dx_Sprite_initWithFile | cocos2d::Sprite::initWithFile |
| cc.Sprite.initWithTexture | js_cocos2dx_Sprite_initWithTexture | cocos2d::Sprite::initWithTexture |

##3. Inheritance##

In Cocos2d-html5 2.x, we need to use different init functions in `create` function when extending a class, such as:

	var MySprite = cc.Sprite.extend({
		ctor:function(){
			this._super();
			// Custom initialization
		}
		// add your properties and functions
	});
	MySprite.create = function(filename,rect){
		var sprite = new MySprite();
		// Init  with texture and rect
		sprite.initWithTexture(fileName, rect);
		return sprite;
	};
    
    // Create your sprite like this
    var sprite = MySprite.create(texture,cc.rect(0,0,480,320));
    
In Cocos2d-JS, we only need to override ctor function with correct arguments, and call _super function.

	var MySprite = cc.Sprite.extend({
		ctor:function(filename,rect){
			this._super(filename,rect);
			// Custom initialization
		}
		// add your properties and functions
	});
    
    // Create your sprite like this
    var sprite = new MySprite(texture,cc.rect(0,0,480,320));

It's very easy to understand this for html5 engine, because we supported `new` operator.

But in JSB it's a little bit tricky, the `_super` function we will call Sprite's ctor function in C++ level: `js_cocos2dx_Sprite_ctor`, and this function not only instantiate the Sprite object, but also invoked `cc.Sprite.prototype._ctor` and pass all parameters. This `_ctor` function is a js level wrapper for the real initialization of the Sprite object according to the parameters passed, and finally user's custom ctor process will be done.
