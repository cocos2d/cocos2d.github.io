Supported scripting languages include lua, C++ and Java Script. 

Lua: based on Cocos 2d-x luabinding, it can run on Windows, Mac, Andorid, iOS.
 
C++: based on Cocos 2d-x, it can run on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. 

JavaScript: based on Cocos 2d-jx, which includes Cocos2d-x jsbinding and Cocos2d HTML5. Interface of jsbinding is compatible with that of HTML5. Game codes can run in Cocos2d-x and HTML5 native engine. When packaging projects to Win32, Mac, iOS and Android, the default setting is JSBingding. When packaging projects to HTML5, the default setting is HTML5 engine. 

Extra functions: For Android devices, enable "support x86 architecture CPU", the android APP
