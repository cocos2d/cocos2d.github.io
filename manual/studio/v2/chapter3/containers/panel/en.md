#### Scenario 1: If you do not display the contents of the container outside
When you want to hide the content thatâ€™s bigger than the panel, you can use attribute "clipping" so the panel will clip the content

#### Scenario 2: Set the background fill a container and fill effects
There are two options to fill the color: solid color background, gradient background. You can choose color and set the opacity of the background; When you select a gradient background, you need to set the starting color and ending color, and opacity can be set separately for these two colors.
