# No Android Devices Found？

There are a few reasons why you might be getting an error message when trying to get files onto your Android device. Following are some options for you to solve these problems.

1 Check USB cable.
 
Some data lines are just charging cable, having no ability to transfer data. 

2 Replug to check the wire the device are attached properly.

Reconnect the device to check the USB ports.

3 Try another USB interface.

Power supply shortage of the USB port may lead to the unrecognized connection.

4 Try another data line.

A bad USB component may cause errors such as "unrecognized USB device". 

5 Change the USB connection options.

The default option may be "charging". The issue can be solved by changing the mode to "mass storage". Different devices have different options. I choose two popular mobiles to show how to changing the connection modes.

6. Enable USB debugging mode? USB debugging mode is also Developer mode, allows apps to be copied via USB to the device.  For different Android versions there will be different configurations to turn the USB debugging mode.  
    
(1) Android 1.5 - Android 3.2, Settings > Application > Develop > enable "USB debugging". There may be slightly differences for phones with different ROM.

(2) Android 4.0.X，Settings > Developer Options > Enable “USB Debugging”.

(3) Android 4.1.X，Settings > Developer Options > Enable “USB Debugging”.

(4) Android 4.2 - Android 4.3，Settings > "About phone” > "Build Number” > Developer Options> Enable “USB Debugging”.

7.  Restart the computer or Android device

    Multiple programs are running at the same time, and that leads to timeout errors. Restart the Android device, run Cocos Studio, try to connect again.
