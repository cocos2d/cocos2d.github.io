### Download ###

[Cocos2d-x-3.0beta.zip](http://cdn.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x-3.0beta.zip)

### Highlights ###

* New renderer. Renderer has being decoupled from the Scene Graph. It supports auto-batching and auto-culling.
* Added template containers. `cocos2d::Map<>`, `cocos2d::Vector<>`
* Label supports: `shadow`, `glow` and `outline` (beta)
* Added Joint support in the physics subsystem
* Added Console: A simple TCP console that lets you debug and inspect your game remotely
* `tools/project_creator/project_creator.py` includes a GUI to simplify the game creation process. It also allows you to create the game in any given directory.
* Added support to build Android's APK files in the `android-build.py` script
* Added `Scheduler::performFunctionInCocosThread()`. It supports executing a function in the cocos2d thread
* `Director` emits the following events using the `EventDispatcher`: `AFTER_UPDATE`, `AFTER_DRAW`, `AFTER_VISIT` and `PROJECTION_CHANGED`
* Added Cocos2dxActivity.java which inherits from native activity. Integrating 3rd Android SDK would be much easier on v3.0.

### Documents for v3.0 ###
* [Introduction of New Renderer](../manual/framework/native/renderer/en.md)
* [Mechanism of Event Dispatcher](../manual/framework/native/input/event-dispatcher/en.md)
* [Physics Integration](../manual/framework/native/physics/physics-integration/en.md)
* [Particle System Comparison of v2.x and v3.0](../manual/framework/native/graphic/particle/v3/en.md)
* [Improved Label in v3.0](../manual/framework/native/gui/label/v3/en.md)
* Template containers: [cocos2d::Map<>](../manual/framework/native/data-structure/v3/map/en.md), [cocos2d::Vector<>](../manual/framework/native/data-structure/v3/vector/en.md). v3.0 uses `cocos2d::Map<>` instead of CCDictionary, `cocos2d::Vector<>` instead of CCArray.
* [cocos2d::Value](../manual/framework/native/data-structure/v3/value/en.md) wrapping many basic data types such as `int`,`float`,`double`,`bool`,`unsigned char`,`char*` and `std::string`.
* GUI System series: [Overview](../manual/framework/native/gui/overview/en.md), [UI Containers](../manual/framework/native/gui/container/en.md) like Layout, ScrollView, PageView, and [UI Widgets](../manual/framework/native/gui/widget/en.md) including  CheckBox, LoadingBar, Slider, Button, TextField etc.
* [JavaScript Remote Debugging with Firefox debugger](../manual/framework/native/scripting/javascript/js-remote-debugger/en.md) would be helpful to developers using JavaScript bindings on cocos2d-x
